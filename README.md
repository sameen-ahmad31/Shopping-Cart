## Shopping Cart Project - Coffee Shop in Madrid, SpainðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
I have developed a shopping cart project for a coffee shop based in Madrid, Spain, using SQL, Python, and Flask. The website allows users to interact with various features, and here's a summary of its functionalities:

- User Authentication:
   - Users can log in or sign up.
   - During sign up, if a chosen username already exists in the database, the user is notified and can choose to proceed to the home page or retry the sign-up process.
   - Upon incorrect login credentials, the user is notified and given the option to try logging in again or sign up.

- Product Search and Description:
   - Users can search for items on the website.
   - Clicking on an item reveals its detailed description.
   - If a user is logged in and the item is in stock, they can add it to their cart via the search bar, the product page, or the website.

- Shopping Cart:
   - Only logged-in users can add products to their shopping cart.
   - Users can view, add, edit, check out, or delete items from their cart.
   - The website ensures that users cannot buy negative quantities or more items than available in the inventory.
   - The database is updated when a user completes the checkout process.

- Order History:
   - Logged-in users can access their order history, displaying a list of previously purchased items and the total cost of each order.
   - Users can sort their order history in ascending or descending order.
   - The user can search for a specific product in their past orders.

- Product Display:
   - The website presents products in various categories, with a minimum of 10 products available.
   - Users can view all products in a particular category, with a minimum of 3 categories available.
   - Each product display includes images, available quantity, and price information.

- User Sign-up:
   - New users can create an account and sign up.

- User Interface:
   - The website showcases a professional look, featuring a logo, product descriptions, and images.

- Client-Side Validation:
   - The website incorporates JavaScript-based client-side validation for input forms, ensuring the quantity added to the cart cannot be negative.

Overall, the shopping cart project offers users an interactive and seamless experience while allowing them to browse, shop, and manage their purchases efficiently.
